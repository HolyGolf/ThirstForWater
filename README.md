# ThristForWater
This plugin adds a water thirst mechanic that can be quenched by drinking water from a bottle or directly from a reservoir.

![craft](/images/2.png)

If you drink a bottle of water, there is a certain chance that you will get poisoned. You can also drink directly from the reservoir (Shift + Right Click on water), but if you are not the king of fortune, then you will get poisoned.â€‹

I recommend boiling water in the furnace ^-^

If you have only 3 points of water left, then you cannot run. Unless, of course, you turn it off in the configs.

![zero](/images/4.png)

If there are no points left, then you will start dying. Hooray!

And of course you can customize a lot in the configuration file.
