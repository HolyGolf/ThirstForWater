# ThristForWater
This plugin adds a water thirst mechanic that can be quenched by drinking water from a bottle or directly from a reservoir.

![craft](/images/222.png)

If you drink a bottle of water, there is a certain chance that you will get poisoned. You can also drink directly from the reservoir (Shift + Right Click on water), but if you are not the king of fortune, then you will get poisoned.

- When you run, the water disappears faster.

- In the default nether, water disappears a little faster =)

- Purified water restores 35 points, and ordinary water restores 20 points.

- I recommend boiling water in the furnace ^-^

```yml
Note: Remember that if you are AFK, then the water disappear anyway.
```

If you have only 3 points of water left, then you cannot run. Unless, of course, you turn it off in the configs.

```yml
PlaceHolders:

%thirst_percents%
%thirst_status%
%thirst_indicator1%
%thirst_indicator2%
```
```yml
Commands:

/tfw
/tfw help
/tfw reload (Thirstforwater.tfw.reload)
/tfw settings (Thirstforwater.tfw.settings).
/tfw enable | disable (Thirstforwater.tfw.settings).
```
```yml
Permissions:

Thirstforwater.tfw.settings
Thirstforwater.tfw.reload
thirstforwater.nothirst - With this permission, the player's thirst is not reduced
Thirstforwater.tfw.vip - With this permission, thirst is spent longer (x2 slower)
```
When you are saturated with water, the indicator turns blue.

If there are no points left, then you will start dying. Hooray!

And of course you can customize a lot in the configuration file.
